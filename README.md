# Wacky pearls mod

This is a mod that i made over the summer, because i thought making mods was pretty cool (It is, it's just very mind melting). 
If you have any suggestions on what to add feel free to let me know here!
<br>For now, the mod contains the following:

### The bouncy pearl:
- It bounces off walls/floors/ceilings
- The number of time it bounces is determined by how much slimeballs you used in the crafting table (8 bounces max)

### The phantom pearl:
- It goes through blocks
- The number of blocks it goes through is determined by the amount of phantom membranes you used on the crafting table (16 blocks max)

### The redstone pearl:
- It sticks to any surface, waits and teleports you once the wait is over
- The timer is determined by the amount of redstone dust you used in the crafting table (8 seconds max)
